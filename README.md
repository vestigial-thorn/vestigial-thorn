# Where do we go from here?

## Setting Intention

I don't know the course of where this goes.
If all goes well, I will have help. And it won't be just my decision.

What I do know is that I want to build something. I want a place to be able to
share my ideas that I can't get to on my own. I want to collaborate with others
and share it with the world.

This will be the platform for moving in that direction. A place for me to learn
and to teach the way I see us all sharing the world.


## Needs
