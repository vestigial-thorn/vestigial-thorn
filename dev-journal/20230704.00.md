Today I setup the hosting of the website for this project.

This is the first time doing this step in a long time and it feels really good
to do. Even though what is up is such a small thing it has a feeling of
commitment that just working on these things so often does not.

So I'm checking in this.

next likely steps:

forwarding the purchased URL to go the site rather than the test URL that is
provided by the AWS S3 hosting.
