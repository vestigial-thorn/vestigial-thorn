Of course I already am doing the thinking too far out. ðŸ˜…

I am trying to stick to one thing at a time, and I'm already in the weeds of
thinking up scripts to autoincrement the dev journal articals.

Also the fact I'm thinking of test first. That might not be the worst and
actually keep me on track. Hopefully ðŸ¤ž

Another step ahead before even testing is some folder structure. Normally, I'd 
want to do this later, but given I don't know what will be easiest for Nx, which
will be crucial to things later, I want to get to that. (Also, learning this new 
shiny is nice too.)

In my trying to setup nx, it seemed easiest to go ahead with an React integrated 
monorepo. So now I'm having to decide on framework configuration. Now 
investigating CSS frameworks. Ooh, remembered I should look into the usage of 
the UI library. So I just went with the LESS config, since the Ant Design docs 
pointed out LESS as having a loader.
